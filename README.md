# ERCF-linear-buffer

This is a filament buffer system designed to replace the "caged loops" style of buffer that is popular, such as the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Patch.  This buffer differs from caged loops in that the filament is pushed down a very long linear channel as a single loop.  The narrow, yet wide channel prevents the filament from twisting.  When a particular channel is in use, the filament is retracted out of the channel and only contacts half of the pulley leading to very little drag in the system.  The channels are cut from 3/8 inch thick foam board.

     NOTE: It is recommended that you find ones with a rubber seal.
     Remove the seals with a sharp tool, and then use a cleaner such
     as Break Cleaner to completely remove all grease from the
     bearing.  The pulleys should spin like a fidget spinner when
     completed.

2 x N / 3 - Buffer Channel Brace Bracket
            NOTE: You will want a minimum of 2 braces per channel
            to support the foam board and mount the buffers to 
            whatever you'll be using. So in a 9 channel MMU system
            you will want: 2*9/3= 6 Brackets.

28 x N - 6mm x 3mm disc magnets 
         NOTE: Depending on the quality of your magnets you may be able
         to use fewer.  The parts are designed to accomodate a lot of 
         magnets on the assumption that you will be using cheap ones from
         AliExpress or Amazon.  If you have genuine N52's for example, far
         fewer will be required.  Experiment.
